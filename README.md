Blockchain based website where any can play games and win games to earn NFTs (non-fungible token) !!

Go (https://tokli.ml) -> Just Login -> Play simple games -> break high score -> Win NFTs !!

We will send you NFT on your Ethereum Address (which will be generated by us on Sign up or if you already have one we will send it there) with which you can do any thing like sell it on NFT market place like (https://opensea.io) or use it without any copyright issues.
